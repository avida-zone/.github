# AVIDA ZONE

Welcome to the AVIDA code repositories, we are thrilled to have you here!

**To see it in action - please checkout our [short video] to see all this in action**


The repos here contain the code submitted for the Injective 2023 Hackathon. Here is some useful link to guide you around:

- [UI for AVIPAD]: The code for the [launchpad]
- [CW contracts]: The CosmWasm Smart contracts for onchain functionalities of AVIPAD
- [Adaptor]: A modification on the [cw20-adaptor by InjectivLabs], see [diffs]
- [Ursa Services]: The mock environment intended ONLY to be used as a demonstration. It performs operations for verifiable credential issuers and holders. For the actual flow please see [AnonCreds specification, a project by the Hyperledger Foundation]

You can it out by 3 simple steps:

1. Go and get the Vectis Smart Contract Wallet [browser extension]
2. Go to https://vectis.space and creat a wallet on Injective testnet and install the identity plugin
3. Go to [AVIPAD] to create you first rgToken or get some existing ones!
